# Example publisher/subscriber scripts

To use these scripts, the sources directory needs to be mounted.  In cheribsd, use the `mount-sources` alias.

The `composition_composed.sh` script stands alone and initiates a composed publisher and subscriber.

The `publisher_not_composed.sh` and `subscriber_not_composed.sh` scripts are meant to be used together from separate terminals.
